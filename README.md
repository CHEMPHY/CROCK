# CROCK
A very simple clone for Gaussian superimposition (ROCS-like)

CROCK is a free and simple program to superimpose two molecules using Gaussian functions.
It is very similar to ROCS, Shape and PAPER. It uses a reference conformation and
a multimol2 file containing diverse conformations of the target molecule (such as the
output from the ALFA program).

Both analytic and grid-based version are implemented. Simplex and BFGS optimization 
routines are available.

Default is grid-based and Simplex.
